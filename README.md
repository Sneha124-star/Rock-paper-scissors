# Rock-paper-scissors

A mini project on rock-paper-scissors by using JavaScript,HTML ,CSS. Where the user plays with the computer.

âœ… I learned a lot about DOM events and how to navigate through different aspects of JS such as calling functions firing up the events etc.This is the fist project that I have created using DOM manipulation,HTML and CSS.Helped by TOP https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation to clear some doubts on JS.

ðŸ”´ I found DOM events to be tricky at first but with help and lot of trials and learning I could finish.
